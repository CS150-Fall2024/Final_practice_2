//14.(40 - 60 pts)English Text to Morse Code and Morse Code to English Text Converter
/**Write a program that converts English-language phrases into Morse code
and Morse code back to English-language phrases.
The program will open the english.txt file to read the English phrase and
open the morse.txt to write the converted English phrase in Morse code.
We will ASSUME here that the English text is all in capital letters,
with no punctuation or special characters, except for numbers.
You will read the English phrase from the file character by character and convert
each character to Morse code and write the code for each character to the output file
where each code is separated by a space.
Use conversion below
